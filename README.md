Hi there, I'm Shoheb Mohammad Tanin 👋
I’m a passionate backend software engineer with extensive experience in leading teams and building scalable, high-performance backend systems. My expertise spans across backend technologies, with a deep focus on Go (Golang), distributed systems, and optimizing server infrastructure.

🛠️ Backend Engineering (Go, Node.js, Databases)
I specialize in building efficient and scalable backend solutions using Go (Golang). I have hands-on experience designing RESTful APIs, optimizing databases (SQL and NoSQL), and ensuring seamless deployment processes. I leverage frameworks like NestJS for Node.js as well as tools like Redis, PostgreSQL, and DynamoDB to build resilient and high-performance server-side applications.

🚀 Go (Golang) Development
Go is my go-to language for backend development, and I excel at building fast, concurrent, and maintainable code. I focus on optimizing application performance, implementing efficient concurrency models, and designing well-structured API services.

🖥️ API Development & Microservices Architecture
I have extensive experience designing and developing RESTful APIs and implementing microservices architecture. I work with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC to ensure smooth communication between services, along with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for streamlined development processes.

🗄️ Database & Caching
I work with a variety of databases and caching systems, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and DynamoDB, ensuring data integrity, high availability, and optimal performance. My expertise includes database design, optimization, and handling complex data queries.

🔧 DevOps & Infrastructure
Along with backend development, I have hands-on experience working with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes to manage infrastructure, deployment, and scaling of backend services.

👨‍💼 Leadership & Collaboration
As a Team Lead, I have successfully guided development teams, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within scope, and at the highest quality. I take pride in mentoring developers, conducting code reviews, and fostering a collaborative and innovative team environment.
